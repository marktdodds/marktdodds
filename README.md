👋 Hi, I’m @marktdodds

👀 I’m interested in anything computer related really.

🌱 I’m currently researching Databases and Distributed Systems for my Masters thesis, but I'm also delving into Solana/Rust and the crypto-sphere on the side.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. The current passion-project is [SolHabits](solhabits.com) so if you're interested in that (or anything really) 
shoot me a message.

📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marktdodds). If you're coming here from a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@marktdodds) you can drop a 
comment on there too.
